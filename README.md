# Moment Propagation 
This repository contains the source code (as described in the publications below) to transform a given neural network (NN), trained with standard dropout beforehand, into an NN that is able to approximate MC dropout in a single forward-pass by propagating the first two moments (Expectation E, Variance V) through the network
